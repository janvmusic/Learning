## Differences between Node.js and the Browser

- Both Node and browsers use the same language: Javascript
- Building apps for web and building Node apps, it's something completely different
- Node allows Javascript developers to be able to work Frontend and Backend

### What changes is the environment

- Working in as a web developer, means that you are working most of the time with:
  - DOM manipulation
  - API requests
  - Cookies
- All of this does not exist in Node environment. You do not have access to `document` or `window`
- Node provides a different API though it's modules
- Node allows you to control the environment in which your code runs
- Node supports `commonjs` & `ES modules`
