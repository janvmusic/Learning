## The role of Algorithms in Computing

## Algorithms

- An **algorithm** is a procedure that takes input or inputs and then after **executing certain steps produces an output** or a set of outputs, this happens during a **finite amount of time**
- Its a **tool for solving** well-specified computational problems
- An _instance of a problem_ is the input needed to compute a solution
- A _correct_ algorithm solves a problem during a finite amount of time

### Data structures

- Its a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications
- Selecting the right data structure is crucial to solve a problem

### Algorithms as a technology

- Algorithms uses `computing time` which represents the resource that _fuels_ the algorithm.
- `Memory` as well its part of algorithms, selecting right algorithms to save memory is a must

### Efficiency

- Different algorithms devised to solve the same problem often **differ** dramatically in **their efficiency**
  - Example: MergeSort vs InsertionSort

### Algorithms and other technologies

- Consider algorithms as tools. The System performance depends on choosing efficient algorithms as much as fast hardware
- Algorithms are at the core of most technologies used in contemporary computers
- Having a solid base of algorithm knowledge and technique defines a truly skilled programmer.
