# Divide and Conquer

The divide-and-conquer algorithm breaks down a large problem into smaller sub-
problems, which themselves may be broken down into even smaller sub problems.

For `divide-and-conquer` you solve a given problem recursively

Remember that recursion has the following:

1. **Divide** the problem in one or more sub problems
2. **Conquer** the sub problems by solving them recursively
3. **Combine** the sub problems solutions to form a solution to the original problem

## Recurrences

A `recurrence` is an equation that describes a function in ter of its value on other argument (smaller)

### Cases

1. Base -> no recursion needed to get the value
2. Recursive -> Recursion invocation of the function on different input

## Substitution Method

## Recursion-tree method

## Master Method

## Akra Bazzi Method
