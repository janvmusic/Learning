# Divide and Conquer

The divide-and-conquer algorithm breaks down a large problem into smaller sub-
problems, which themselves may be broken down into even smaller sub problems.

For `divide-and-conquer` you solve a given problem recursively

Remember that recursion has the following:

1. **Divide** the problem in one or more sub problems
2. **Conquer** the sub problems by solving them recursively
3. **Combine** the sub problems solutions to form a solution to the original problem
