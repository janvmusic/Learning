# Flyweight Design Pattern

- Use sharing to support large number of fine-grained objects efficiently
- It is a structural design pattern such as Facade, Adapter & Decorator
- Flyweight pattern can be used when we want to create a large number of similar objects, Remember that it is based on: sharing is caring
- Remember that each object must have properties divided by intrinsic (properties that make the object unique), extrinsic(properties that can be shared between objects, managed by the user)
