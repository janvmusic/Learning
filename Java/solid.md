# Single Responsibility Principle

- A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
- A class should have only one job.
- A class should have only one responsibility.

# Open/Closed Principle

- Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- You should be able to extend a classes behavior, without modifying it.

# Liskov Substitution Principle

- Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

# Interface Segregation Principle

- Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.
- Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

# Dependency Inversion Principle

- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
