## Swagger!
### What is Swagger?
- **Swagger.io** allows you to make API documentation that is human & machine readable
- **Swagger.io** tries to be simple, not like WADL
- Uses technologies like **JSON** or **YAML**
- **Swagger.io** is an OpenAPI specification. This specification asks you information like:
  - API operations supported
  - API calls parameters & API return types
  - Lets you set authorization
  - Contact information & API version

### What problem solves?
- API documentation
- Readable for humans and machines
- Fast code generation

### What is an OpenAPI
- API description format for REST APIs. 
- Allows you to describe your entire API as:
  - Available endpoints
  - Operations on each endpoint
  - Authentication methods
  - Contact info & licenses... etc
- Can be written using __JSON__ or __YAML__
- Pending to read [OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md)

#### **What is Swagger?**
- It's a set of open-source tools that help you to design, build, document & consume REST APIs
- Available tools:
  - Editor
  - UI
  - Codegen (I believe this is used in current project)

#### **Why use OpenAPI?**
- Ability to APIs to describe their own structure (This is awesome)
- Design-first users
- Code generator for client libraries
- Ability to create interactive API documentation that lets you call API from browsers
- Testable
