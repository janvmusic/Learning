## How to Ruin Your Career in 8 Easy Steps  
### 1. You are not planning ahead
- Set a plan for: 2, 5 & 10 years ahead
- Imagine what you want to be doing when you "grow up"
- Remember that you can always can adjust your plan
- Be intentional about your learning

### 2. You are waiting for recognition
- Competence is a requisite, but if you don't speak out then it's invisible 
- Get comfortable on telling people about your success
- Remember to use "Lesson learn"
- Keep a weekly log of your work. Notes would be fine
- Keep a tracking on your 1-on-1 talks
- Remember your intentions
- Just like you did with Miho, ask for what YOU want

### 3. All or nothing outlook
- "But a career is not a zero-sum game. Just because other people will advance faster than you at a certain times in your/their life, doesn't mean you can't advance at all."
- Don't give up, adjust your expectations!
- Do not compare with others(too much) it will discourage you!!

### 4. Undersell yourself
- The narrative matters. Value your work
- Don't be a victim
- REMEMBER, really DON'T BE A VICTIM
- Don't underestimate the impact of a powerful narrative
- In your CV get a "who am I and what am I looking for" section
- 

### 5. Not doing networking
- Even if it feels artificial, you will need it
- Having a strong network gives you access to knowledge
- People from your network can provide help!
- Creating a network is like building luck into your life
- Try to make meaningful connections, remember good questions, lead to good answers.
- Do not focus on small talk
- Start by thinking of what you can do for them, not what they can do for you

### 6. Blame others for things you can control
- Always find the lesson behind a failure
- Embrace failure. You are a human and you will fail
- What could you do different? Always ask this question

### 7. Blame yourself for things you can't control
- Not all the time is your fault
- Remember you are not a tree and if you find yourself in a toxic environment then move out from there.


### 8. Get comfortable
- It's ok to feel comfortable within your job. For a little bit it's good to enjoy it
- Don't be the smartest guy in the room
- Challenge yourself to get to the next level
- Evaluate your position every 2 or 3 years
